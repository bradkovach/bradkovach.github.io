This is the first post on my new website. I have put this site together as a place where I can rapidly author content about what I am thinking about and working on. I hope you find it useful.

### What is this?

This site is an Angular SSR application. It is generated using Angular with some parsers and formatters for Markdown with Front Matter. The site is hosted on GitHub Pages, and the source code is available on GitHub.

### Why did I build this?

I have blogged at bradkovach.com in the past. The site used WordPress, and I found it to be a bit heavy for my needs. I wanted to build a site that was more lightweight and easier to maintain. I also wanted to build a site that was more in line with my current interests in web development, i.e. Angular, TypeScript.

### Why abandon WordPress?

WordPress has been my bread and butter for decades. I still love WordPress, but its post editor and infrastructure are more than I need for an outlet for my best ideas. I want to build a site that is heavily focused on code, and writing, and for that, I wanted to be able to write in a format that lets me focus on the content, code, so that I can enjoy writing with minimal fuss and distraction.

In recent years, WordPress has made a huge investment in the Gutenberg block editor. While the UX for the editor is marvelous, it, too, is far too intrusive for my needs. Should my needs change in the future, I have no doubt that WordPress will be there to meet them, but for now, I am excited to author content in Markdown. My hope is that fewer obstacles and barriers to entry will let me write more often and more freely.

### Other Fun Stuff

Many times, I have lots of fun ideas for things that I can create with Angular and TypeScript. I intend to make this the home for those experiments and ideas. I will be reviewing my StackBlitz projects in the coming days and migrating useful, interesting and fun projects to this site.

For starters, I have migrated a few Angular goodies, including...

- [NYT Connections Client and Editor](/connections)
- [Notary Public Utilities](/notary) - a set of tools to generate documents, useful for notaries public
- [Acquire Scorecard](/games/acquire) - a scorecard for the board game Acquire
