<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>What is an Offer?</h3>
<p>
	An offer is a rate that a supplier is willing to sell you gas at. The offer
	includes a commodity charge rate and a term (1 or 2 years). The commodity
	charge is but one part of your overall bill. On your bill these are broken
	up into four categories:
</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Delivery and distribution</dt>
	<dd>
		These costs are a per-therm charge. The more you use, the more you pay.
	</dd>
	<dt>Energy Supply</dt>
	<dd>
		These costs are the subject of Choice Gas negotiation. You can see an
		Index rate, Fixed/Therm, Fixed/Month, or a combination of these.
	</dd>
	<dt>Other Costs</dt>
	<dd>
		There are some administration fees here. If you have balanced billing,
		adjustments will appear in this section.
	</dd>
	<dt>Taxes and Fees</dt>
	<dd>
		State/County taxes appear here. Some per-therm charges may also appear
		in this section.

<h3>Types of Rates</h3>
<h4>Index or CIG-adder</h4>
<p>
	These rates track the current market price, known as CIG. If the current
	natural gas prices are low and stable, these rates can be a good choice.
</p>
<h4>Fixed/Therm</h4>
<p>
	These rates are a fixed price per therm. If you use 100 therms at 50
	cents/therm, the commodity charge will be $50. If you use 200 therms at 50
	cents/therm, the commodity charge will be $100. The rate will not change for
	the duration of your Offer term.
</p>
<h4>Fixed/Month (commonly called Winter rates or Budget assist rates)</h4>
<p>
	These rates are a fixed price per month. If you are offered a Fixed/Month
	rate of $50, you will pay a $50 commodity charge every month, regardless of
	how much gas you use. However, be mindful of other per-therm charges
	(Volumetric Charge and Taxes) on your bill. Just because your commodity
	charge is fixed, it doesn't mean your bill will also be.
</p>
<h4>Gas Cost Adjustment Regulated Rate (formerly known as the Pass-On Rate)</h4>
<p>
	This rate is a fixed price per therm, but it can change every month. The
	rate is regulated by the Wyoming Public Service Commission, and is usually
	quite competitive. In some ways, it is an index rate, but in other ways it
	can be considered a fixed/therm rate, which is why it is in a category of
	its own.
</p>
<h4>Blended Rate</h4>
<p>
	These rates are a combination of the Fixed/Therm and Fixed/Month rates. You
	will typically pay the lower of an index/cig rate, or a fixed/therm rate.
